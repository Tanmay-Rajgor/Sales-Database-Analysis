This is a document which i created to keep track of errors i made while i working on this project, and solution of issues.


1. Foreign key 'FK__Sales__EmployeeI__2A4B4B5E' references invalid table 'Employees'. 
Ans : I got this error when i was wrting sql query for creating new tables, Sales, Customers, Employees, Product.
during this process, i gave references from Sales table to ProductID, CustomerID and EmployeeID. and run query and i got above mentioned error.
so i searched about it on google and found that i got this error because i was referencing to EmployeeID before i created the table. so quick solution 
of this error was to move query for creating employee table before sales table query. and problem was solved and all tables were created as expected.
